# üîó USB Monitor using Netlink

USB Monitor is desktop application for Linux, developed in C++ and Qt, providing real-time tracking of USB device connections and disconnections. It's designed to be highly efficient and deliver detailed information.

The key to its uniqueness is the use of **Netlink sockets**. This offers a fast, direct communication channel between the Linux kernel and user-space applications. Thanks to Netlink, USB Monitor gets immediate notifications about device events as soon as they occur. This is far more efficient than older methods that relied on constantly scanning `dmesg` system logs or `/sys` files.

This project showcases how modern system mechanisms can be leveraged to create convenient and powerful tools that simplify and enhance the Linux experience.

## **Features**

- **Real-time Monitoring**  
  Immediate reaction to USB device connect/disconnect events thanks to direct communication with the Linux kernel via Netlink (uevent).

- **Low System Load**  
  Uses a blocking `select()` call instead of constant polling ‚Äî the processor is engaged only when an actual event occurs.

- **Detailed Information**  
  Displays physical path, device name/manufacturer, and storage characteristics, gathered from various sources.

- **Modern Interface (Qt)**  
  Features a convenient table, a pleasant dark theme, and a console for event logging.

## **How It Works**

The project comprises two logically separated components: `USBMonitorGUI` (interface) and `USBWorker` (logic).

### Netlink Socket Creation

Upon startup, `USBWorker` creates an `AF_NETLINK` family socket and subscribes to the `NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT` multicast group. This step turns the application into a passive listener for "uevents"‚Äîmessages the Linux kernel generates whenever hardware states change (connection, disconnection, modification, etc.).

  ```bash
    netlink_socket = socket(AF_NETLINK, SOCK_RAW, NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT);
  ```

### Event Processing (Udev Events)

The Worker waits in an infinite loop for data using the `select()` function, which efficiently blocks the thread until a new event arrives.

 ```bash
   const int ret = select(netlink_socket + 1, &fds, nullptr, nullptr, &tv);
     if (ret < 0) {
       if (errno == EINTR) continue; 
         perror("select");
         break;
     }
   if (ret == 0) continue;
 ```

Each received message is a null-byte-separated string containing `KEY=VALUE` pairs. This data is parsed into a map for easy access.

  ```bash
    void USBWorker::parseUEvent(const char* buffer, std::map<std::string, std::string>& uevent_data) {
        const char* s = buffer;
        while (*s) {
            std::string line(s);
            if (const size_t equals_pos = line.find('='); equals_pos != std::string::npos) {
                uevent_data[line.substr(0, equals_pos)] = line.substr(equals_pos + 1);
            }
            s += line.length() + 1;
        }
    }
   ```

The application intelligently filters events, focusing only on those with `SUBSYSTEM` set to `usb` or `block`. Why both?

* A `usb` event contains basic connection information (Vendor ID, Product ID).
* A `block` event pertains to block devices and provides detailed storage information associated with the given USB device.

For an `add` event, external commands (`lsusb`, `lsblk`) are executed to translate technical IDs into human-readable names, models, and sizes.

For a `remove` event, the device is simply identified by its `DEVPATH` and removed from the table.

### Safe Communication with GUI

Since `USBWorker` runs in a separate thread, it cannot directly manipulate GUI elements. The well-established **Qt signals and slots** mechanism is employed for communication:

1.  When `USBWorker` processes an event, it emits a signal (e.g., `deviceConnected`).
2.  This signal is connected to a slot in the `USBMonitorGUI` class within the main thread.
3.  Qt ensures safe signal delivery between threads, preventing concurrency issues and maintaining application stability.

## **Monitoring System Device Events via Netlink**

To track device connection/disconnection events in Linux, the **Netlink** mechanism (family `NETLINK_KOBJECT_UEVENT`) is used, generated by the kernel. This project programmatically listens for these events (see `usbworker.cpp`).

For visualization and verification of this process, a study was conducted using `udevadm monitor` and Wireshark with the `nlmon` module.

<img width="861" alt="456067941-3d8c9d4f-1646-4802-8114-e4fa7c1358ba" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29e2512d-45bb-4d42-923b-32698f1b989e" />

The screenshot presents a dual monitoring setup.
* In the **upper part**, Wireshark with `nlmon0` captures *general* Netlink packets as network traffic. Although Wireshark may not always fully parse *all* nuances of UEVENT messages (due to Netlink protocol specifics and `nlmon` capture peculiarities), it confirms that Netlink packets exist and are transmitted through the kernel.
* In the **lower part**, the terminal with `udevadm monitor` directly displays *target* Netlink UEVENT events in an easy-to-read format. This *clearly confirms* the generation of these events by the kernel upon USB device connection. This C++ program performs a similar process, programmatically listening to these same events.
